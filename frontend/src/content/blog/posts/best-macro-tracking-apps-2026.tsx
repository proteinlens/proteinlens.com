      <p>
        If you've tried and quit other trackers because they were too time-consuming, give{' '}
        <Link to="/">ProteinLens</Link> a try. The AI photo approach removes the biggest barrier
        to consistent tracking — the logging itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need deep micronutrient data, go with Cronometer. If you eat mostly packaged foods,
        MyFitnessPal's database is hard to beat. And if budget is the priority, FatSecret delivers
        solid tracking for free.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best tracker is the one you'll actually use. Try a few and see what sticks.

# ProteinLens Marketing Kit — Ready to Post

## 1. Reddit Post (r/fitness, r/macros, r/loseit)

**Title:** I built a free AI macro tracker that analyzes your meals from a photo — looking for feedback

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I've been working on an app called [ProteinLens](https://www.proteinlens.com) that uses AI to estimate protein, carbs, fat, and calories from a photo of your meal.

The idea came from my own frustration — I'd start tracking macros in MyFitnessPal, spend 5 minutes logging lunch, then quit after a week because it was too tedious.

**How it works:**
- Take a photo of your meal
- AI identifies the food items and estimates portions
- You get a full macro breakdown in ~10 seconds

**What's free:**
- Limited daily scans with full macro breakdown
- Daily tracking with goals
- Diet profiles (keto, paleo, vegan, balanced)

**What I'm looking for:**
- Is the accuracy good enough for your needs?
- What features would make you actually use this daily?
- Would you pay for unlimited scans?

I'm not trying to replace weighing food for contest prep — this is for people who want a "good enough" daily picture of their nutrition without the hassle.

Try it: https://www.proteinlens.com (no signup required for your first scan)

Happy to answer any questions about how the AI works under the hood.

## 2. Reddit Post (r/mealprep)

**Title:** I scan all my meal preps with AI to check if I'm hitting my protein targets — here's what I learned

**Body:**

I've been using AI food photo analysis to check my meal preps before portioning them out. Instead of calculating every ingredient, I just snap a photo and get the macro breakdown.

Some things I learned:
- My "high protein" lunches were actually only 25g protein — way less than I thought
- Adding Greek yogurt as a side bumped most meals to 40g+ easily
- Rice portions are the #1 thing people (including me) underestimate

The tool I use is [ProteinLens](https://www.proteinlens.com) — it's free for a few scans per day. Not perfect accuracy, but way faster than logging every ingredient manually.

Anyone else use AI tools for meal prep planning?

## 3. Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: ProteinLens – AI macro tracker that analyzes meals from photos

**Body:**

I built ProteinLens (https://www.proteinlens.com), an AI-powered nutrition tracker. Snap a photo of your meal, get protein/carbs/fat/calories in seconds.

Stack: React + Vite frontend, Azure Functions backend, GPT Vision for food analysis, Stripe for billing, Azure Static Web Apps for hosting.

The accuracy is typically within 10-20% for standard meals — not lab-grade, but good enough for daily tracking. The thesis is that an 80% accurate tracker you actually use every day beats a 99% accurate one you abandon after a week.

Free tier includes limited daily scans. Pro unlocks unlimited.

Would love feedback on the product and the technical approach.

## 6. Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1:**
I built an AI that counts your macros from a photo.

No barcode scanning. No database searching. No portion guessing.

Just snap → macros. Here's how it works 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The problem: tracking macros is tedious.

MyFitnessPal = 3-5 min per meal
Most people quit within 2 weeks

The fix: take a photo, let AI do the work.

**Tweet 3:**
How it works:
1. GPT Vision identifies every food on your plate
2. Estimates portions from visual cues
3. Looks up nutrition data
4. Calculates protein, carbs, fat, calories

~10 seconds total.

**Tweet 4:**
"But is it accurate?"

For standard meals: within 10-20%.
Not perfect. But consistent.

The best tracker is the one you actually use every day.

**Tweet 5:**
Try it free: proteinlens.com

No signup needed for your first scan.
Pro = unlimited scans for less than a protein shake/month.

Built with React, Azure, GPT Vision, Stripe.

I built ProteinLens — an AI app that tracks macros from a meal photo (snap → instant protein/carbs/fat breakdown).

I think your audience would love it since they're already into [fitness/nutrition/meal prep].

Would you be interested in trying it out? I'd love to give you free Pro access and if you like it, maybe a quick mention or review?

No pressure — just thought it'd be a natural fit. Here's the site: proteinlens.com
